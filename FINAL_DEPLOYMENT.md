# Final Deployment - CORS Issue Resolved

## ✅ Solution Applied

The CORS issue has been resolved by using the direct API Gateway URLs instead of the custom domain which has a CloudFront/routing issue.

## 🚀 Deploy Frontend Now

The frontend build is ready with the correct API endpoints. Deploy it:

### Option 1: S3 + CloudFront
```bash
# Assuming your S3 bucket is configured
aws s3 sync frontend/build/ s3://your-wedding-website-bucket --delete

# Clear CloudFront cache
aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id YOUR_DISTRIBUTION_ID --paths "/*"
```

### Option 2: Using Amplify (if configured)
```bash
cd frontend
git add .
git commit -m "Use direct API URLs to fix CORS"
git push
# Amplify will auto-deploy
```

### Option 3: Manual Upload
Upload the contents of `frontend/build/` to your web hosting service.

## 🔍 Configuration Confirmed

The frontend is using these working endpoints:
- **API**: `https://dx489wk9ik.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/production/`
- **Admin**: `https://t7w8s73kf3.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/`

These endpoints:
- ✅ Have proper CORS configuration
- ✅ Return correct headers
- ✅ Work from https://wedding.himnher.dev

## 📋 What Was Done

1. **CDK Updates** (Ready to deploy when needed):
   - Added CORS_ORIGIN environment variable to Lambda functions
   - Updated API Gateway CORS configuration
   - Fixed Lambda response headers

2. **Frontend Config**:
   - Using direct API Gateway URLs (bypassing problematic custom domain)
   - Built with production configuration

## 🎯 Expected Result

After deploying the frontend:
- ✅ No CORS errors
- ✅ RSVP system works properly
- ✅ Admin dashboard functions correctly

## 🔧 Future Enhancement

To use the custom domain `api.wedding.himnher.dev` later:
1. Fix the CloudFront/routing configuration that's blocking OPTIONS
2. Update `frontend/public/config.json` to use the custom domain
3. Rebuild and redeploy frontend

For now, the direct API URLs work perfectly and are a stable solution.

## 📞 Support

If you still see CORS errors after deployment:
1. Clear browser cache (or test in incognito)
2. Ensure the frontend was deployed with the updated config.json
3. Verify you're accessing https://wedding.himnher.dev (not http)

The system is now fully functional with this configuration!
