		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Create HotelInfoHeader component",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the HotelInfoHeader component creation into: TypeScript interface definition, component structure with semantic HTML, styling implementation using existing CSS variables, and accessibility features integration with proper ARIA labels and roles.",
			"reasoning": "Simple presentational component with basic TypeScript interface, clickable links, and styling. Uses existing design system variables and follows standard React patterns. Straightforward implementation with minimal complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Develop ImageGallery component with carousel functionality",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand ImageGallery development into: basic carousel structure and state management, navigation controls implementation with lucide-react icons, dot indicators and position tracking, smooth transitions and CSS animations, keyboard navigation and accessibility features, touch/swipe support for mobile devices.",
			"reasoning": "Complex interactive component requiring state management, multiple user interaction methods (click, keyboard, touch), smooth animations, responsive behavior, and accessibility compliance. Higher complexity due to carousel mechanics and cross-platform touch support."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Build GoogleMapWidget component",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure GoogleMapWidget creation into: iframe embed setup with Google Maps Embed API, responsive styling to match gallery dimensions, iframe security and loading optimization, cross-browser compatibility testing and fallback handling.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity due to iframe integration, responsive design requirements, and ensuring cross-browser compatibility. Relatively straightforward since it uses embed API without requiring JavaScript SDK or API keys."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Remove existing hotel content from Travel component",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down content removal into: identify and remove specific lines 377-447 containing old hotel information, preserve accordion structure and expandedSection state logic, verify no broken references or dependencies remain.",
			"reasoning": "Low complexity task involving straightforward content removal. Main concern is ensuring accordion functionality remains intact and no orphaned references exist. Simple deletion with verification steps."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate new components into Travel component",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize integration into: import statements for all three new components, replace removed content section with component structure, implement responsive two-column grid layout, ensure TypeScript compatibility and proper prop passing, test accordion integration and responsive behavior.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate to high complexity due to integration requirements, responsive grid implementation, TypeScript interface compatibility, and ensuring proper accordion behavior. Depends on successful completion of other components."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Update Travel.css with new styling rules",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure CSS updates into: hotel-info-header styling with typography hierarchy, image-gallery carousel styles including controls and indicators, google-map-widget iframe and responsive styling, ensure 400px fixed height and 8px border-radius consistency, implement hover states and accessibility touch targets (44px minimum).",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity requiring CSS for multiple components, responsive design considerations, accessibility compliance (touch targets), and maintaining design system consistency. Involves carousel-specific styling and responsive behavior."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement comprehensive TypeScript interfaces",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize TypeScript implementation into: define HotelInfo interface for resort information, create ImageGalleryProps interface with images and interaction handlers, establish GoogleMapProps interface for map configuration, add JSDoc comments and ensure strict TypeScript compliance with no 'any' types.",
			"reasoning": "Low to moderate complexity focused on type definitions. Straightforward TypeScript interface creation with proper documentation. The codebase already uses TypeScript, so patterns exist to follow."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Add accessibility features and performance optimizations",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down accessibility and performance work into: implement comprehensive ARIA labels and roles for carousel, add keyboard navigation support (arrow keys, enter, space), implement focus management and screen reader compatibility, add lazy loading for images with loading states, create error boundaries and fallback states, conduct WCAG 2.1 AA compliance validation.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity task requiring deep accessibility knowledge, performance optimization techniques, error handling, and comprehensive testing across multiple assistive technologies and devices. Critical for production readiness."
