# Task ID: 1
# Title: Refactor Home page to display only Hero section
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Modify the Home component in App.tsx to render only the Hero component instead of the current full-page layout that includes Travel, Events, Attire, Registry, and FAQ sections.
# Details:
1. Locate the Home component or main routing logic in App.tsx
2. Identify where Travel, Events, Attire, Registry, and FAQ components are currently rendered on the home page
3. Remove these components from the home page render logic while keeping them available for individual page routes
4. Ensure the Hero component remains as the sole content on the home page
5. Verify that navigation menu still provides access to the removed sections as separate pages
6. Update any routing configuration to ensure Travel, Events, Attire, Registry, and FAQ are accessible via navigation
7. Test that the home page no longer scrolls through all content and only displays the Hero section with couple's information, photos, and heartfelt message
8. Ensure responsive design is maintained for the simplified home page layout

# Test Strategy:
1. Navigate to the home page and verify only the Hero section is displayed
2. Confirm the page is no longer scrollable through multiple sections
3. Test that the navigation menu still provides links to Travel, Events, Attire, Registry, and FAQ pages
4. Click each navigation item to ensure the removed sections are still accessible as individual pages
5. Verify the Hero section displays correctly with couple's information, photos, and heartfelt message
6. Test responsive behavior on mobile and desktop to ensure the simplified layout works across devices
7. Check that no broken links or missing content issues were introduced during the refactoring

# Subtasks:
## 1. Update Home component to render only Hero component [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Modify the Home function in App.tsx to render only the Hero component instead of the current layout that includes Travel, Events, Attire, Registry, and FAQ components
### Details:
In App.tsx line 17-28, change the Home function to return only <Hero /> component instead of the current multiple components. Remove Travel, Events, Attire, Registry, and FAQ components from the Home component JSX while keeping the Hero component as the sole content.

## 2. Verify individual route accessibility for removed components [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Ensure that Travel, Events, Attire, Registry, and FAQ components are still accessible via their individual routes after being removed from the Home component
### Details:
Test that the existing individual routes in App.tsx lines 38-43 (/travel, /events, /attire, /registry, /faq) still work correctly and render their respective components when accessed directly. Verify routing configuration remains intact for these separate pages.

## 3. Test navigation menu functionality after home page refactor [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2
### Description: Verify that the Navigation component still provides proper access to all sections as separate pages after the Home component modification
### Details:
Test the Navigation component links in frontend/src/components/Navigation.tsx lines 37-88 to ensure all navigation items (Travel, Stay, Events, Attire, Registry, FAQ, RSVP) still function correctly and direct users to the appropriate pages. Verify active state highlighting works properly.

## 4. Validate Hero component standalone functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Ensure the Hero component works correctly as the sole content on the home page and maintains its responsive design and animations
### Details:
Test that the Hero component in frontend/src/components/Hero.tsx maintains its full functionality when rendered alone on the home page. Verify all animations (framer-motion), images, styling, and responsive behavior work correctly without the other components present.

## 5. Perform comprehensive testing of refactored home page layout [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4
### Description: Conduct thorough testing to ensure the refactored home page meets all requirements and maintains website functionality
### Details:
Perform end-to-end testing of the refactored application to ensure: home page displays only Hero section, navigation works correctly to all other sections, removed components are accessible via direct routes, responsive design is maintained, and overall user experience is preserved.
