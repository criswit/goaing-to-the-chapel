# Description: Replace six travel information accordion sections with friendly work-in-progress messages and remove the Quick Reference section entirely
# Details:
Replace content in six accordion sections (Cultural Etiquette & Respect, Getting Around Goa, Explore Goa, Safety & Scam Prevention, Health & Safety, Money & Communication) with friendly, concise work-in-progress messages that maintain the website's tone. Each message should be tailored to the specific section topic and convey active development while encouraging visitors to check back later. Preserve the existing accordion structure, expand/collapse functionality, and section icons. Remove the Quick Reference section completely (lines ~979-1024 in Travel.tsx) including all subsections like Emergency Contacts, Important Numbers, Local Services, and Transportation Links. Ensure the removal doesn't break the component structure or cause layout issues with remaining sections.

# Test Strategy:
Verify all six accordion sections display appropriate WIP messages while maintaining expand/collapse functionality. Confirm Quick Reference section is completely removed with no broken references or layout issues. Test that accordion icons and styling remain consistent. Validate that the removal doesn't affect other sections or cause console errors. Test responsive behavior to ensure messages display properly on all screen sizes.
