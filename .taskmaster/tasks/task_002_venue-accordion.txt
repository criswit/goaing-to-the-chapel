# Task ID: 2
# Title: Develop ImageGallery component with carousel functionality
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Build an interactive image carousel component for resort images with navigation controls and touch support
# Details:
Create `src/components/ImageGallery.tsx` with TypeScript. Implement carousel for mbgoose1.jpg through mbgoose4.jpg from /public folder. Add navigation using ChevronLeft/ChevronRight from lucide-react. Include dot indicators for current position, smooth 300ms transitions, keyboard navigation (arrow keys), touch/swipe support for mobile using touch events or react-spring-gesture. Auto-size for responsive layouts with 400px fixed height. Implement lazy loading for performance optimization.

# Test Strategy:
Test image loading, navigation functionality, keyboard accessibility, touch gestures on mobile devices, responsive behavior, and smooth transitions

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create base ImageGallery component structure with TypeScript interface [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the foundational TypeScript component with proper interface definitions for props, state, and image data structure
### Details:
Create `src/components/ImageGallery.tsx` with TypeScript interface for component props including image array, alt text, and optional styling props. Define state interface for current image index and loading states. Import required dependencies including React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback), lucide-react icons (ChevronLeft, ChevronRight), and motion from framer-motion. Set up basic component structure with proper TypeScript annotations following existing project patterns.

## 2. Implement core carousel functionality with image rendering and navigation [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Build the main carousel display with image container, navigation buttons, and dot indicators
### Details:
Create image container with 400px fixed height and responsive width. Implement current image display with proper aspect ratio handling. Add ChevronLeft and ChevronRight navigation buttons with proper positioning and styling. Create dot indicator system showing current position among mbgoose1.jpg through mbgoose4.jpg. Implement state management for currentIndex with bounds checking. Add smooth CSS transitions with 300ms duration for image changes and indicator updates.

## 3. Add keyboard navigation and accessibility features [done]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Implement keyboard controls (arrow keys, Enter, Space) and comprehensive ARIA labels for screen reader support
### Details:
Add keyboard event listeners for ArrowLeft, ArrowRight, Enter, and Space keys. Implement focus management for keyboard navigation. Add comprehensive ARIA attributes: aria-label for carousel container, aria-current for active image, role='tablist' for dot indicators, and aria-label for navigation buttons. Ensure all interactive elements are focusable and have proper focus indicators. Add keyboard navigation instructions for screen readers.

## 4. Implement touch and swipe support for mobile devices [done]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Add touch event handling for swipe gestures on mobile and tablet devices
### Details:
Implement touch event listeners for touchstart, touchmove, and touchend events. Calculate swipe direction and distance to determine if navigation should occur. Add minimum swipe distance threshold (e.g., 50px) to prevent accidental navigation. Implement momentum and gesture recognition for smooth mobile experience. Ensure touch events don't interfere with scroll behavior. Add visual feedback for touch interactions and prevent default behaviors where appropriate.

## 5. Implement lazy loading optimization and error handling [done]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Add image lazy loading with loading states, error boundaries, and performance optimizations
### Details:
Implement lazy loading for images using the loading='lazy' attribute and intersection observer for better performance. Add loading states with skeleton placeholders while images load. Create error boundaries for handling image load failures with fallback content. Implement preloading for next/previous images to improve navigation speed. Add proper image optimization attributes like sizes and srcSet if needed. Include fallback states for network failures and optimize for web delivery with appropriate image formats.
