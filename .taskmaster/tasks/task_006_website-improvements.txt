- Follow existing component patterns from ImageGallery.tsx
- Use established CSS variables from App.css design system

**Dependency Justification:**
This subtask depends on tasks 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 being completed first because the photo gallery component will need to integrate seamlessly with the established content sections. The hero section (6.1) will define the overall page structure and CSS classes that the gallery component must align with. The women's attire section (6.2) and men's attire section (6.3) will establish the content categories, descriptions, and layout patterns that the photo gallery must reference and enhance. The gallery component will need to match the established section styling, reference the same attire categories defined in those sections, and provide visual supplements to the textual descriptions created in tasks 6.2 and 6.3.
