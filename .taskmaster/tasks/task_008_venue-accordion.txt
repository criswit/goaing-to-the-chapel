# Task ID: 8
# Title: Add accessibility features and performance optimizations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, image optimization, and responsive testing
# Details:
Add comprehensive ARIA labels for carousel navigation (aria-label, aria-current for active image, role='tablist' for indicators), keyboard support (arrow keys, enter, space), focus management. Implement lazy loading for images with proper loading states, optimize image sizes for web delivery. Add error boundaries and fallback states for component failures. Ensure all interactive elements meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards with proper color contrast and focus indicators.

# Test Strategy:
Test with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS), verify keyboard-only navigation, run Lighthouse accessibility audit, test image loading performance, validate responsive design on multiple devices and browsers

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement comprehensive ARIA labels for carousel navigation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add accessibility attributes to carousel components including aria-label, aria-current for active image, and role='tablist' for indicators
### Details:
Add ARIA labels to carousel navigation elements: aria-label for carousel container, aria-current='true' for active image indicator, role='tablist' for indicator buttons, aria-label for previous/next buttons with descriptive text. Ensure carousel announces current position (e.g., 'Image 2 of 5') to screen readers. Add aria-live region for dynamic content updates.

## 2. Add keyboard navigation support for interactive elements [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement keyboard support with arrow keys, enter, space, and proper focus management for all interactive components
### Details:
Add keyboard event handlers: arrow keys for carousel navigation (left/right for previous/next), enter and space for activation of buttons and indicators, tab navigation between focusable elements. Implement focus management with visible focus indicators, focus trapping in modals if present, and logical tab order. Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible without mouse dependency.

## 3. Implement lazy loading for images with proper loading states [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add lazy loading functionality for carousel images with loading spinners, error states, and progressive enhancement
### Details:
Implement lazy loading using Intersection Observer API for images below the fold. Add loading='lazy' attribute to img elements, implement loading states with skeleton placeholders or spinners, error handling for failed image loads with retry mechanism. Include proper alt text for all images and ensure graceful degradation for browsers without lazy loading support.

## 4. Add error boundaries and fallback states for component failures [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement React error boundaries around components with user-friendly fallback UI and error logging
### Details:
Create ErrorBoundary components wrapping carousel, map, and hotel info components. Implement fallback UI that maintains page functionality when individual components fail. Add error logging for debugging purposes and graceful degradation paths. Include retry mechanisms for recoverable errors and clear error messages for users.

## 5. Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with color contrast and focus indicators [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2
### Description: Audit and fix color contrast ratios, focus indicators, and other accessibility requirements to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
### Details:
Run accessibility audit using Lighthouse and axe-core. Ensure minimum 4.5:1 color contrast ratio for normal text and 3:1 for large text. Implement visible focus indicators with 2px outline and high contrast colors. Add proper heading hierarchy, ensure minimum 44px touch targets for mobile, verify semantic HTML structure. Test with high contrast mode and ensure compatibility.
