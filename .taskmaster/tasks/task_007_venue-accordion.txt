# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Define proper TypeScript interfaces and types for all new components and their props
# Details:
Create TypeScript interfaces for HotelInfo (name, website, address, phone), ImageGalleryProps (images array, alt texts, dimensions), GoogleMapProps (coordinates, zoom, styling options). Add proper type definitions for carousel state management, touch event handlers, and responsive breakpoint handling. Ensure strict TypeScript compliance with no 'any' types. Add JSDoc comments for better developer experience.

# Test Strategy:
Run TypeScript compiler with strict mode, verify no type errors, test intellisense support in IDE, validate prop type checking at runtime

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create centralized types directory and base interfaces [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create src/types directory with index.ts file and define base TypeScript interfaces for HotelInfo, ImageGalleryProps, and GoogleMapProps
### Details:
Set up the types directory structure at src/types/index.ts. Define HotelInfo interface with properties: name (string), website (string), address (string), phone (string). Create ImageGalleryProps interface with images (array of image objects with src, alt, dimensions), altTexts (string[]), and dimensions (width/height). Define GoogleMapProps interface with coordinates (lat/lng), zoom (number), and styling options object. Ensure all interfaces have proper JSDoc comments.

## 2. Define carousel and touch event handler types [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Create comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for carousel state management, touch event handlers, and navigation controls
### Details:
Add CarouselState interface with currentIndex (number), isTransitioning (boolean), totalImages (number). Create TouchHandlers interface with onTouchStart, onTouchMove, onTouchEnd event handlers using React.TouchEvent types. Define NavigationProps with onPrevious/onNext functions, currentIndex, totalItems. Add KeyboardHandlers type for arrow key navigation using React.KeyboardEvent. All handlers should be properly typed with void return types.

## 3. Implement responsive breakpoint and styling type definitions [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Define TypeScript types for responsive breakpoint handling and component styling configurations
### Details:
Create BreakpointConfig interface with mobile (number), tablet (number), desktop (number) values. Define ResponsiveStyles type with CSS-in-JS style objects for different screen sizes. Add ComponentTheme interface for consistent styling across components including colors, spacing, borderRadius, shadows. Create MediaQueryHandlers type for responsive behavior callbacks. Ensure strict typing for CSS properties using React.CSSProperties where appropriate.

## 4. Add strict TypeScript compliance and eliminate 'any' types [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3
### Description: Review and refactor existing component files to ensure strict TypeScript compliance with no 'any' types
### Details:
Audit Travel.tsx, RSVP.tsx, Events.tsx, and FAQ.tsx components for any usage of 'any' types. Replace with proper type definitions from the centralized types directory. Update function parameters and return types to be explicit. Ensure all props interfaces are properly typed. Add generic constraints where appropriate for better type safety. Configure TypeScript strict mode settings in tsconfig.json if not already enabled.

## 5. Add comprehensive JSDoc comments for developer experience [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4
### Description: Add detailed JSDoc comments to all interfaces, types, and component props for enhanced IDE intellisense and documentation
### Details:
Add comprehensive JSDoc comments to all TypeScript interfaces with descriptions, parameter explanations, and usage examples. Document component props with @param tags for each property. Include @example blocks showing typical usage patterns. Add @since tags for version tracking. Document complex types with detailed explanations of their purpose and constraints. Ensure all public APIs have complete JSDoc coverage for optimal developer experience in IDEs.
