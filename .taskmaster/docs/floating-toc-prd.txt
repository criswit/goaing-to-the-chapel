# Cultural Compass Floating TOC - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview
Implement a sophisticated "Cultural Compass" floating table of contents for the wedding events timeline that serves as an ambient intelligence navigation system for the comprehensive 11-event, 2-day wedding timeline.

## Problem Statement
The new wedding events section will feature 11 detailed events across 2 days with complex cultural transitions (Indian/American/Fusion). Users need:
- Quick navigation between events without losing context
- Cultural context awareness as they browse the timeline  
- Progress tracking through the 2-day celebration
- Mobile-friendly timeline navigation
- Seamless integration with existing smooth scroll patterns

## Solution: Cultural Compass Design
A floating TOC that embodies the "wedding planner's clipboard" metaphor - an intelligent, context-aware navigation aid with progressive disclosure.

## Core Features

### 1. Progressive Disclosure Interaction Model
- **Dormant State**: Minimal floating cultural indicator (color-coded dot)
- **Hover/Touch State**: Expands to condensed mini-timeline with next 2-3 events
- **Expanded State**: Full timeline overlay with all 11 events
- **Navigation State**: Smooth scroll with cultural transition animations

### 2. Cultural Intelligence System
- **Color Morphing**: Smooth transitions between Indian (saffron #FF6B35), American (blue #4A90E2), Fusion (purple #8B5CF6)
- **Cultural Context Preview**: Shows upcoming cultural transitions
- **Timeline Progress Arc**: Circular progress indicator for 2-day timeline
- **Ambient Behavior**: Predictive visibility based on scroll patterns

### 3. Responsive Design Strategy
- **Desktop (1024px+)**: Fixed sidebar compass with full timeline visibility
- **Tablet (768px-1023px)**: Floating button expanding to overlay
- **Mobile (320px-767px)**: Bottom-anchored indicator with swipe-up drawer

## Technical Requirements

### Component Architecture
- CulturalCompass.tsx - Main floating component

## Implementation Phases
1. Core component structure and scroll spy logic
2. Cultural color system and transition animations  
3. Responsive behavior and gesture support
4. Integration with existing timeline and testing
5. Accessibility features and performance optimization
6. Cross-browser testing and deployment
