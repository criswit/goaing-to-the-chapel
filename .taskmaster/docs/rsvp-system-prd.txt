# RSVP System Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview
Implement a comprehensive RSVP system for the wedding website that allows guests to respond to invitations, manage their attendance, and provide necessary information for event planning.

## Current State
- RSVP component exists but shows "Under Construction" placeholder
- Static frontend-only website deployed via AWS CDK (S3 + CloudFront)
- No backend infrastructure currently exists
- React-based frontend with TypeScript, Framer Motion, and Lucide icons

## Core Requirements

### 1. RSVP Form Interface
- **Multi-step form** for better UX on mobile and desktop
- **Guest lookup system** using invitation codes or names
- **Party management** for guests bringing plus-ones or families
- **Event-specific responses** (ceremony, reception, pre-wedding events)
- **Dietary restrictions and special requests** collection
- **Contact information** updates and verification
- **Accommodation preferences** if applicable
- **Transportation needs** (airport pickup, local transport)

### 2. Guest Management System
- **Pre-populated guest list** from wedding planning data
- **Invitation code generation** for secure access
- **Guest party grouping** (families, couples, individuals)
- **RSVP status tracking** (pending, confirmed, declined, partial)
- **Guest information management** (names, contacts, preferences)
- **Plus-one handling** and approval workflow

### 3. Backend Infrastructure
- **Serverless API** using AWS Lambda and API Gateway
- **Database** for guest data and responses (DynamoDB)
- **Email notifications** for confirmations and reminders
- **Admin dashboard** for wedding planners to manage responses
- **Data export capabilities** for vendors (caterer, venue, etc.)
- **Security measures** to protect guest privacy

### 4. User Experience Features
- **Mobile-first responsive design** matching website aesthetic
- **Progressive form saving** to prevent data loss
- **Confirmation emails** with details and QR codes
- **Edit capabilities** for guests to update responses
- **Deadline management** with gentle reminders
- **Multi-language support** if needed for international guests

### 5. Admin Features
- **Real-time dashboard** showing RSVP statistics
- **Guest list management** with bulk operations
- **Communication tools** for sending updates
- **Reporting and analytics** for planning purposes
- **Data export** in various formats (CSV, PDF)
- **Integration capabilities** with other wedding planning tools

## Technical Specifications

### Backend Requirements
- AWS CDK infrastructure as code
- Serverless architecture for cost efficiency
- DynamoDB for scalable data storage
- SES for email functionality
- Lambda functions for API endpoints
- API Gateway for REST API management
- CloudWatch for monitoring and logging

### Security Requirements

- Efficient database queries
- CDN integration for static assets

## User Stories

### Guest User Stories
1. As a wedding guest, I want to easily find and access my RSVP using my invitation code
2. As a guest with a plus-one, I want to RSVP for both myself and my partner
3. As a guest with dietary restrictions, I want to specify my needs clearly
4. As a guest, I want to receive confirmation of my RSVP via email
5. As a guest, I want to be able to change my RSVP if my plans change
6. As a guest, I want to indicate my transportation needs for the wedding
7. As a guest, I want the RSVP process to be quick and intuitive on my phone

### Admin User Stories
1. As a wedding planner, I want to see real-time RSVP statistics and trends
2. As a wedding planner, I want to export guest lists for vendors
3. As a wedding planner, I want to send reminder emails to non-respondents
4. As a wedding planner, I want to manage guest information and plus-ones
5. As a wedding planner, I want to track dietary restrictions and special requests
6. As a wedding planner, I want to monitor system usage and performance

## Success Metrics
- 95%+ RSVP completion rate
- Less than 2% form abandonment rate
- Average completion time under 5 minutes
- 99.9% system uptime during critical periods
- Zero data security incidents
- Positive feedback from guests on ease of use

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core RSVP Form
- Basic RSVP form with guest lookup
- Essential fields (attendance, meal preferences)
- Email confirmations
- Basic admin view

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features
- Multi-event RSVP options
- Plus-one management
- Dietary restrictions and special requests
- Guest information updates

### Phase 3: Advanced Admin Features
- Comprehensive dashboard
- Reporting and analytics
- Bulk operations
- Integration capabilities

### Phase 4: Polish and Optimization
- Performance optimization
- Enhanced UX/UI
- Advanced security features
- Mobile app-like experience

## Risk Mitigation
- **Data Loss**: Regular backups and point-in-time recovery
- **High Traffic**: Auto-scaling infrastructure
- **Security Breaches**: Multiple security layers and monitoring
- **System Downtime**: Redundancy and failover mechanisms
- **User Experience Issues**: Extensive testing and feedback loops

## Constraints and Assumptions
- Must integrate with existing AWS CDK deployment pipeline
- Budget considerations for AWS services usage
- Timeline constraints for wedding date
- Guest technical literacy varies widely
- International guests may have different time zones and languages
- Some guests may prefer phone/email RSVP options

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with wedding registry
- Guest communication portal
- Photo sharing capabilities
- Wedding day logistics coordination
- Post-wedding thank you system
