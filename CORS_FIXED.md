# ✅ CORS Issue FIXED

## Solution Summary

The CORS issue with `api.wedding.himnher.dev` has been resolved! The problem was the base path mapping - the custom domain was trying to route to `/production` but that path doesn't exist.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. API Gateway Configuration
- Added Gateway Responses for 4XX/5XX errors with CORS headers
- Fixed base path mapping to use root path (`''`) instead of `'production'`
- CORS headers now returned even on error responses

### 2. Frontend Configuration
- Updated API URLs to use `https://api.wedding.himnher.dev/` (without `/production`)
- Both `rsvpApi.ts` and `config.json` updated

## Verification

CORS is now working correctly:

```bash
$ curl -X OPTIONS https://api.wedding.himnher.dev/rsvp/validate \
    -H "Origin: https://wedding.himnher.dev"

HTTP/2 204
access-control-allow-origin: https://wedding.himnher.dev
access-control-allow-headers: Content-Type,X-Amz-Date,Authorization,X-Api-Key,X-Amz-Security-Token,X-Auth-Token
access-control-allow-methods: OPTIONS,GET,PUT,POST,DELETE,PATCH,HEAD
access-control-allow-credentials: true
```

## Frontend Deployment

The frontend is built and ready to deploy:

```bash
# Deploy to S3/CloudFront
aws s3 sync frontend/build/ s3://your-wedding-website-bucket --delete
aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id YOUR_DISTRIBUTION_ID --paths "/*"
```

## Status

- ✅ CDK deployed successfully
- ✅ CORS headers working on api.wedding.himnher.dev
- ✅ Frontend updated to use correct API URLs
- ✅ Frontend built and ready for deployment

The RSVP system should now work without any CORS errors!
